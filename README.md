Terraform module to provision Datadog resources.

The module consists of the following submodules:

  - [monitors](modules/monitors) - to provision Datadog [monitors](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitors/)
  - [synthetics](modules/synthetics) - to provision Datadog [synthetics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/)
  - [permissions](modules/permissions) - to look up all available Datadog [permissions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/permissions/)
  - [roles](modules/roles) - to provision Datadog [roles](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac)
  - [slo](modules/slo) - to provision Datadog [Service Level Objectives](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/service_level_objectives/)
  - [child_organization](modules/child_organization) - to provision Datadog [child organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/)
  - [organization_settings](modules/organization_settings) - to manage Datadog organization's settings

__Notes on Datadog child organizations:__

* Users can be added to the parent-organization and/or multiple child-organizations and switch between them from the user account settings menu
* The parent-organization can view the usage of individual child-organizations, allowing them to track trends in usage
* The Multi-organization account feature is not enabled by default. Contact Datadog support to have it enabled
* Free and Trial organizations cannot enable SAML
* We can only create Datadog child organizations with terraform, but cannot destroy them. When trying to destroy, the following error is thrown:
  ```
    Warning: Cannot delete organization.

    Remove organization by contacting support (https://docs.datadoghq.com/help).
  ```

> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Introduction

Datadog resources (monitors, roles, etc.) are defined as [catalog](catalog) of YAML configuration files.

We maintain a comprehensive [catalog](catalog) of Datadog resources and welcome contributions via pull request!

The [examples/complete](examples/complete) in this module uses the catalog to provision the monitors on Datadog.

The [examples/synthetics](examples/synthetics) shows how to provision synthetic tests on Datadog for monitoring.
Consult the [synthetics README](modules/synthetics) module for more details.

The [examples/rbac](examples/rbac) shows how to use custom RBAC to provision Datadog roles with permissions and assign roles to monitors.

The [examples/slo](examples/slo) shows how to provision Service Level Objectives on Datadog for SLO monitoring.

The [examples/child_organization](examples/child_organization) shows how to provision Datadog child organizations.

The [examples/organization_settings](examples/organization_settings) shows how to provision Datadog organization settings.




## Usage


Provision Datadog monitors from the catalog of YAML definitions:

```hcl
module "monitor_configs" {
  source  = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  version = "1.0.2"

  map_config_local_base_path = path.module
  map_config_paths           = var.monitor_paths

  context = module.this.context
}

module "datadog_monitors" {
  source = "cloudposse/platform/datadog//modules/monitors"
  # version = "x.x.x"

  datadog_monitors     = module.monitor_configs.map_configs
  alert_tags           = var.alert_tags
  alert_tags_separator = var.alert_tags_separator

  context = module.this.context
}
```

Provision Datadog synthetics:

```hcl
locals {
  synthetics_files = flatten([for p in var.synthetic_paths : fileset(path.module, p)])
  synthetics_list  = [for f in local.synthetics_files : yamldecode(file(f))]
  synthetics_map   = merge(local.synthetics_list...)
}

module "datadog_synthetics" {
  source = "cloudposse/platform/datadog//modules/synthetics"
  # version = "x.x.x"

  datadog_synthetics   = local.synthetics_map
  alert_tags           = var.alert_tags
  alert_tags_separator = var.alert_tags_separator

  context = module.this.context
}
```

Provision Datadog monitors, Datadog roles with defined permissions, and assign roles to monitors:

```hcl
module "monitor_configs" {
  source  = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  version = "1.0.2"

  map_config_local_base_path = path.module
  map_config_paths           = var.monitor_paths

  context = module.this.context
}

module "role_configs" {
  source  = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  version = "1.0.2"

  map_config_local_base_path = path.module
  map_config_paths           = var.role_paths

  context = module.this.context
}

locals {
  monitors_write_role_name    = module.datadog_roles.datadog_roles["monitors-write"].name
  monitors_downtime_role_name = module.datadog_roles.datadog_roles["monitors-downtime"].name

  monitors_roles_map = {
    aurora-replica-lag              = [local.monitors_write_role_name, local.monitors_downtime_role_name]
    ec2-failed-status-check         = [local.monitors_write_role_name, local.monitors_downtime_role_name]
    redshift-health-status          = [local.monitors_downtime_role_name]
    k8s-deployment-replica-pod-down = [local.monitors_write_role_name]
  }
}

module "datadog_roles" {
  source = "cloudposse/platform/datadog//modules/roles"
  # version = "x.x.x"

  datadog_roles = module.role_configs.map_configs

  context = module.this.context
}

module "datadog_monitors" {
  source = "cloudposse/platform/datadog//modules/monitors"
  # version = "x.x.x"

  datadog_monitors     = module.monitor_configs.map_configs
  alert_tags           = var.alert_tags
  alert_tags_separator = var.alert_tags_separator
  restricted_roles_map = local.monitors_roles_map

  context = module.this.context
}
```

Provision a Datadog child organization:

```hcl
module "datadog_child_organization" {
  source = "cloudposse/platform/datadog//modules/child_organization"
  # version = "x.x.x"

  organization_name                = "test"
  saml_enabled                     = false  # Note that Free and Trial organizations cannot enable SAML
  saml_autocreate_users_domains    = []
  saml_autocreate_users_enabled    = false
  saml_idp_initiated_login_enabled = true
  saml_strict_mode_enabled         = false
  private_widget_share             = false
  saml_autocreate_access_role      = "ro"

  context = module.this.context
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
